<p>I do not know what i am doing!</p>
<p>This web page will not update! This is going to just waste a bunch of time. I am not even sure if i am doing this correctly.</p>
<p>Well, while i am waiting for my web page to load up, I am going to just type away. This will be a journal of what I did today.</p>
<p>So far today i have not done much. I went to all my classes and did what any normal student would do. I almost forgot to come to Comp Sci. today!</p>
<p>I was about to go and play League of Legends; while I was texting my cousin he asked me if i had any classes left. I instantly realized that I had one more class to go to. So I rushed over to Comp Sci.</p>  
<p>Yay! I was not late. In fact i made it three minutes early.</p>
<p>I am done typing now, I do not feel like waiting for my web page to come up anymore.</p>
